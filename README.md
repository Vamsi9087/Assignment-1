A short explanation
{
This scoring system helps cybersecurity analysts prioritize threats by assigning risk scores based on high-impact keywords related to credential access, privilege escalation, execution, and data exfiltration. Techniques are automatically ranked from highest to lowest risk, allowing analysts to focus first on critical threats instead of manually reviewing hundreds of techniques. This improves investigation efficiency and reduces response time during security incidents.}
