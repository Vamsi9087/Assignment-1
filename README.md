A short explanation
{
Your scoring system helps a cybersecurity analyst prioritize threats by converting each MITRE ATT&CK technique into a simple numeric risk score. Techniques that involve credentials, privilege escalation, lateral movement, or remote/stealthy behavior automatically receive higher scores, so the most dangerous patterns rise to the top of the list. This lets analysts focus first on high‑impact, high‑risk techniques instead of spending time on lower‑risk ones.}
